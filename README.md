📌 Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing hospital cases and patient trends. The dashboard provides insights into patient admissions, disease trends, hospital performance, and treatment outcomes to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare management.

The dashboard helps in:
✅ Tracking patient admissions across different departments.
✅ Analyzing disease prevalence and identifying high-risk conditions.
✅ Monitoring hospital efficiency through bed occupancy and discharge rates.
✅ Assessing patient demographics (age, gender, region) for better resource planning.
✅ Visualizing healthcare trends using dynamic charts and filters.

📊 Key Features
🔹 Admissions & Discharges Overview – Total cases, recoveries, and mortality rates.
🔹 Disease Analysis – Identifies the most common diagnoses and patient conditions.
🔹 Hospital Performance Metrics – Bed utilization, average length of stay, and doctor-patient ratio.
🔹 Patient Demographics – Breakdown of cases by age, gender, and location.
🔹 Time-Series Analysis – Trends in patient inflow and hospital occupancy.
🔹 Interactive Filters & Drilldowns – Enables deep data exploration.
